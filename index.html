  <h1>Your product isn't the problem. But your messaging might be.</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    I help bold brands and creators turn browsers into buyers â€” with copy that earns trust,
    deepens loyalty, and drives revenue without shouting.<br>
    <strong>No gimmicks. No guesswork. Just words that work.</strong>

<section class="section">
  <h2>You've got the traffic. But it's not turning into sales.</h2>
  <p>
    Maybe visitors hover... but donâ€™t click.<br>
    Emails get openedâ€¦ then ignored.<br>
    Or worse â€” they bounce without giving you a second thought.
  </p>

<section class="section">
  <h2>Now imagine this instead.</h2>
  <p>
    Your homepage grips attention.<br>
    Your emails get replies.<br>
    Your follow-ups donâ€™t feel like chasing â€” they feel like *momentum.*

  <h2>Beyond eCom</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™ve sold fashion at London Fashion Week, grew a 5K email list by accident,
    wrote Valentineâ€™s cards that caused HR complaints (long story),
    and yes â€” I birdwatch and grow tomatoes. <br><br>
    Point is: Iâ€™ve seen what makes people *actually respond*.

  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Energy match first. If weâ€™re not aligned, weâ€™re not dining.</li>
    <li>No endless calls. No bloated decks.</li>
    <li>Just straight-up conversion upgrades.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="section">
  <h2>What I Offer</h2>
  <p>
    âœ… Packaged copy rewrites â€” fast, focused, outcome-driven.<br>
    âœ… Custom engagements for launches, funnels, and high-leverage systems.

  <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
